# Alfred TV Calendar
Simple Alfred workflow displaying current TV shows.

## Installation
Download the workflow file from [here](https://github.com/marek-nogiec/alfred-tv-calendar/blob/master/dist/alfred-tv-calendar.alfredworkflow?raw=true) and import it to Alfred (usually just double-click it).

_It's a bigger file than I'd like since it contains all the necessary NodeJS modules._

## Usage
There are two keywords:
- `tv` displays short list (based on http://pogdesign.com/cat) of today's shows
You can also use it to display yesterday's or tomorrow's shows: `tv yesterday`/`tv tomorrow`
- `tvl` displays long list (based on http://thetvdb.com/rss/newtoday.php)
